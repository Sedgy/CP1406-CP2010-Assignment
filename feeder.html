  <h2>Entertaining live music in North Queensland!</h2>
  <p>Most people would say that North Queensland is currently feeling fairly neglected in the way of live music performances. Almost seems as though bands and artists from major cities don't think anyone lives anywhere north of Gold Coast.</p><img src="TCMC Images Docs/musos/Celtic-Fyre-Wall-with-Fire8half.gif">
  <p>But even if bands and artists from places other than North Queensland don't consider us as worth their time, there is no need to fear! All us North Queenslanders have to do is just look a little closer to home to find fantastic bands and artists! If all you are after is an afternoon or evening of live music, then stop looking so far away.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in finding out more about the local talent in North Queensland head over to <a href="TCMCindex.html">Townsville Community Music Centre</a> for more information!</p>
  <p>Don't let the name fool you. Townsville Community Music Centre doesn't limit itself to Townsville artists. There is information about artists from Charters Towers and Cairns on there too!</p><img src="TCMC Images Docs/musos/SNBB1-75.gif" class="SNBB75">
